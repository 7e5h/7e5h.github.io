				Currently, I'm a junior at UTDallas in the computer science program. Right now I'm likely studying or working on various persional projects. Hopefully, at some point, I can find out what I'm supposed to be doing. Oftentimes you can find me longboarding around campus, attending hackathons, or fixing other people's computers. I first started in the computer science route when I first took introduction to computer science during my sophomore year of high school (thanks Mr. Cadle!). Ever since that year I have been trying to learn more and more about computer science, and I'm always looking for new projects.
